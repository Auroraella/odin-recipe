    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons matcha green tea powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the milk and heavy cream. Heat over medium heat until just simmering.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.</li>
        <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to
            coat the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the matcha powder and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean bowl to remove any lumps.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Churn the chilled mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ice cream to a container and freeze until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
